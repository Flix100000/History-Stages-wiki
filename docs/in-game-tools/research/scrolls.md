# Research Scrolls

A scroll is the item that carries a stage into the
[pedestal](/wiki/in-game-tools/research/pedestal). It also carries the research progress, so it is
the scroll rather than the block that remembers how far along a player is.

| Scroll | What it is |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stage Scroll** | Bound to one stage id. Researching it unlocks that stage. |
| **Individual Scroll** | Bound to one player by UUID. Only that player can research it; the tooltip and the pedestal GUI show the owner's name, and the slot is greyed out for everybody else. |
| **Creative Scroll** | Unlocks every stage at once. For testing and creative mode. |

## What happens when research finishes

`defaultScrollCompletion` in
[`[research]`](/wiki/server/config-files/gameplay-toml#research) decides, and a stage can override
it with its own `scroll_completion`:

| Value | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| `consume` (default) | The scroll is used up. |
| `replace` | A fresh scroll for the same stage appears in the pedestal. |
| `open` | An **open scroll** is left behind as a keepsake. |

## The scroll tooltip

The tooltip is fully configurable under
[`[scroll_tooltip]`](/wiki/server/config-files/visual-toml#scroll_tooltip) in **visual.toml**, and
through a dedicated screen in the [Config Editor](/wiki/in-game-tools/in-game-editor).

The pipe-delimited strings below are not meant to be typed. The
[Config Editor](/wiki/in-game-tools/in-game-editor#the-config-editor) has a screen for this one:
sections as rows you drag into order, with their switches and colours next to them and a live
preview of the finished tooltip. The format is documented here because it is what that screen
writes, and because a server owner may end up reading it in the file.

Each entry in `lines` is a pipe-delimited string:

```
id|enabled|spacerBefore|style|text
```

| Part | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `id` | Which section the line controls. |
| `enabled` | Whether the section appears at all. |
| `spacerBefore` | Whether a blank line goes in front of it. |
| `style` | `+`-joined Minecraft formatting names, e.g. `gray+italic`. Empty uses the built-in colour. |
| `text` | Custom text, or empty for the built-in translation. |

The item name is always first and cannot be moved. The sections that **can** be reordered are
`individual_badge`, `owner`, `info1`, `info2`, `tier` and `dependencies`.

The dependency block is built from sub-templates of its own — `dep.header`, `dep.group_header`,
`dep.item`, `dep.stage`, `dep.individual`, `dep.xp`, `dep.separator` — plus icon and colour options
(`dep.icon_fulfilled`, `dep.icon_open`, `dep.icon_unknown`, `dep.color_fulfilled`,
`dep.color_open`).

Unknown ids are ignored, and a known id missing from the list falls back to its default, so a
config keeps working when later versions add sections.

:::note[AND and OR are printed in two different places]
`dep.group_header` sits **above** a group and says how that group's own entries combine — *All of*
or *One of*. `dep.separator` sits **between** groups and always says AND, because groups are always
joined by AND.

They used to be one line, which printed one group's logic in the gap before the next and made an OR
group look like it applied to everything after it. →
[Dependencies](/wiki/stage-file/dependencies#and-or-and-where-the-line-runs)
:::

`hideFulfilledDependencies` drops lines the player has already met, leaving only what is
outstanding. Visibility is worked out *before* a switched-off line disappears, so a met entry whose
line is hidden still settles its OR group.

## The open scroll document

A researched scroll — or an already-unlocked one that a player opens — becomes an **open scroll**: a
book-style GUI describing the stage in full.

![The open scroll document](/img/screenshots/open-scroll.webp)

It has an overview page plus three chapters: **items**, **creatures** and **world**. Locked entries
are drawn as silhouettes with a redacted name by default (`lockedDisplay = "obscured"`), or normally
with `"visible"`.

The **world** chapter is the catch-all for everything that is neither an item nor a creature:

| Group | Contents |
| :--- | :--- |
| Dimensions, Structures, Biomes | As listed in the stage. |
| Zones | By name. An unnamed zone has nothing to show and is left out; the same name in two worlds appears once. |
| Fluids | Under their real in-game name rather than their registry id. |
| Merchant Professions | The profession, with the gated levels named. |
| Trade Offers | Single offers. Merchant, price and levels are in the tooltip; an offer applying to every merchant says so. |
| Merchant Levels | Levels gated across every profession at once. |

A group with nothing in it gets no heading at all.

**Recipes, mods, mod exceptions and addon categories are deliberately absent.** A scroll is a
player-facing description of what a stage holds back, and those four are authoring concepts rather
than things a player can point at.

Chapters, the overview layout, search, entry ids, sort order and the page ink colours are all
configured under [`[open_scroll]`](/wiki/server/config-files/visual-toml#open_scroll) in
**visual.toml**. How far the world behind the page is dimmed is `openScrollBackdrop` in
[`[visuals]`](/wiki/server/config-files/visual-toml#visuals).

### Reading from a lectern

An open scroll can be put into a **lectern** like a book, and right-clicking the lectern opens the
same document straight from the block — handy for library or archive builds. Locks still apply: a
lectern inside a locked area cannot be read from until that area opens.

### Resealing

An open scroll can be crafted back into a sealed Research Scroll through a `reseal_scroll` recipe,
controlled by `enableScrollResealing` in
[`[research]`](/wiki/server/config-files/gameplay-toml#research).

Crafting follows the setting immediately, but JEI and EMI build their recipe lists at startup — so
the entry only appears or disappears in the recipe browser after a restart.

## Giving a scroll by command

For testing, or as a quest reward:

```
/give @s historystages:research_scroll[minecraft:custom_data={StageResearch:"bronze_age"}]
```

Replace `bronze_age` with the stage id. On versions before 1.20.5 the older NBT syntax applies
instead:

```
/give @s historystages:research_scroll{StageResearch:"bronze_age"}
```
