What happens in the background. Lives at `config/historystages/settings/gameplay.toml`, server-owned and
synced to every player who joins — see [Configuration](/wiki/modpack-developers/server-integration/configuration) for how the settings files
are organized as a whole. → [visual.toml](./visual-toml.md) covers what a player sees or hears.

## `[logging]`

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `showDebugErrors` | `true` | Show stage loading errors and warnings in chat on join. |
| `enableRuntimeLogging` | `false` | Write detailed runtime information (stage changes, blocked actions, inventory issues) to `config/historystages/logs/`. |

## `[gameplay]`

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `lockMobLoot` | `true` | Remove locked items from mob drops. |
| `lockBlockBreaking` | `true` | Locked blocks become far harder to break and drop nothing. |
| `lockedBlockBreakSpeedMultiplier` | `0.05` | Break-speed multiplier for locked blocks. `0.05` means 20× slower. |
| `lockItemUsage` | `true` | Prevent using locked items — eating, equipping, attacking with. |
| `lockEntityItems` | `true` | Prevent interacting with or breaking armor stands and item frames holding locked items. |
| `lockBlockInteraction` | `true` | Prevent opening the GUI of locked blocks (chests, furnaces, crafting tables, …). |
| `lockContainerInteraction` | `true` | Prevent moving locked items within containers. |
| `lockEnchanting` | `true` | Prevent applying locked enchantments via anvils and enchanting tables. |

## `[research]`

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `researchTimeInSeconds` | `20` | Default research duration, used when a stage's JSON does not set `research_time`. |
| `researchBoosters` | `[]` | Booster blocks placed under a pedestal to speed up or discount research. Format per entry: `"block_id, speed%, cost%, tier, mode"`. See [Research System](../in-game-tools/research-system.md#research-boosters). |
| `defaultScrollCompletion` | `"consume"` | What happens to a scroll when its research finishes. `consume` uses it up; `replace` puts a fresh scroll for the same stage back into the pedestal; `open` leaves an open scroll as a keepsake. A stage can override this with its own `scroll_completion`. |
| `enableScrollResealing` | `true` | Allow crafting an open scroll back into a sealed one. Crafting follows this immediately, but JEI and EMI build their recipe lists at startup, so the entry only appears or disappears there after a restart. |

## `[loot_replacements]`

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `useReplacements` | `false` | Replace locked loot with something else instead of removing it. |
| `replacementItems` | `[]` | Item IDs to pick a random replacement from. Checked first. |
| `replacementTags` | `[]` | Item tags (e.g. `c:dusts`) to pick a random replacement from. Used when `replacementItems` is empty or exhausted. |

## `[individual_stages]`

The per-player counterparts of the `[gameplay]` locks. Their notification settings live in `visual.toml` under `[notifications.individual]`.

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `lockItemPickup` | `true` | Prevent picking up items locked by individual stages. |
| `lockLoot` | `true` | Handle individually-locked items in Lootr containers and mob loot. Lootr loot is checked against the player it is rolled for; mob drops are shared world items, so they are checked against the killing player. |
| `dropOnRevoke` | `true` | Drop locked items from a player's inventory when their individual stage is revoked. |
| `lockBlockBreaking` | `true` | Individually-locked blocks become far harder to break. |
| `lockedBlockBreakSpeedMultiplier` | `0.05` | Break-speed multiplier for individually-locked blocks. |
| `lockItemUsage` | `true` | Prevent using individually-locked items. |
| `lockBlockInteraction` | `true` | Prevent opening the GUI of individually-locked blocks. |
| `lockEnchanting` | `true` | Prevent applying individually-locked enchantments. |
| `lockRecipes` | `true` | Let individual stages gate recipes at the stations that know who is crafting: crafting table, 2×2 inventory grid, stonecutter, smithing table. Furnaces, hoppers and autocrafters resolve recipes with nobody there and stay global-only. |

## `[structure_lock]`

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `checkInterval` | `10` | Ticks between checks for whether a player is inside a locked structure. |
| `messageEnabled` | `true` | Send a message when a player enters a locked structure. |
| `messageFormat` | `"&cYou cannot enter &e{structure}&c yet!"` | Format of that message. Supports `{stage}` and `{structure}`. |
| `showInChat` | `false` | Also send it to chat, not just the actionbar. |
| `damageEnabled` | `false` | Damage players inside a locked structure. |
| `damageAmount` | `1.0` | Damage per tick interval. |
| `damageInterval` | `20` | Ticks between damage ticks. |
| `lockPadding` | `0` | **Advanced.** Extra blocks around each structure piece when building the lock zone, on top of a fixed 2-block buffer. Range 0–16. |
| `clusterDistance` | `6` | **Advanced.** How far apart two pieces of the same structure can be while still joining into one lock zone. Higher = larger, more filled-in zones. Range 0–32. |
| `blockRightClick` | `true` | Cancel right-click interactions inside a locked structure. |
| `blockLeftClick` | `true` | Cancel left-click interactions inside a locked structure. |
| `blockProjectiles` | `true` | Cancel projectiles the moment they would impact something inside a locked structure. |

## `[biome_lock]`

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `checkInterval` | `10` | Ticks between checks for whether a player is inside a locked biome. Range 1–200. |
| `effectsEnabled` | `true` | Apply potion effects to players standing in a locked biome. |
| `effects` | `["minecraft:blindness, 30, 0"]` | Effects applied. Format per entry: `"effect_id, seconds, amplifier"`. |
| `clearEffectsOnLeave` | `false` | Clear those effects as soon as the player leaves, instead of letting them run out. |
| `messageEnabled` | `true` | Send a periodic message while inside a locked biome. |
| `messageFormat` | `"&cYou cannot survive in &e{biome}&c yet!"` | Format of that message. Supports `{stage}` and `{biome}`. |
| `showInChat` | `false` | Also send it to chat. |
| `damageEnabled` | `true` | Damage players inside a locked biome. |
| `damageAmount` | `1.0` | Damage per tick interval. Range 0.1–100.0. |
| `damageInterval` | `20` | Ticks between damage ticks. Range 1–600. |
| `blockRightClick` | `true` | Cancel right-click interactions inside a locked biome. |
| `blockLeftClick` | `true` | Cancel left-click interactions inside a locked biome. |
| `blockProjectiles` | `true` | Cancel projectiles and explosions the moment they would impact something inside a locked biome. |

## `[zone_lock]`

Zones carry their own rules per zone, so almost nothing about them is configured server-wide. The one thing that is: which item marks out corners in the world.

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `markerItem` | `"minecraft:stick"` | Item used to mark out zone corners. Sneak + left click sets the first corner, sneak + right click the second. Requires permission level 2, the same bar as opening the editor. Without sneaking the item behaves completely normally, so something you already carry is a safe choice. Leave empty to switch marking by item off and use `/history zone` instead. |
