# Hidden Display

`hidden_display` decides what a player who has **not** unlocked the stage sees in place of the real
item. It changes nothing about whether the item is locked — only how it presents itself. Once the
stage is unlocked, everything displays normally again.

```json
{
  "hidden_display": {
    "name_mode": "replace",
    "name_text": "???",
    "tooltip_mode": "replace",
    "tooltip_text": "Unlock the Stone Age to reveal this item.",
    "show_lock_hints": false
  }
}
```

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `name_mode` | String | `"off"` | `"off"` — name unchanged. `"hidden"` — name is cleared. `"replace"` — name becomes `name_text`. |
| `name_text` | String | `""` | The replacement name, used when `name_mode` is `"replace"`. |
| `tooltip_mode` | String | `"off"` | `"off"` — tooltip unchanged. `"hidden"` — extra tooltip lines are stripped. `"replace"` — tooltip becomes `tooltip_text`. |
| `tooltip_text` | String | `""` | The replacement tooltip. `\n` starts a new line. |
| `show_lock_hints` | Boolean | `true` | With `false`, the padlock icon and the "Locked" hint line are left off the tooltip. |

## Taking full control of the tooltip

`show_lock_hints` on its own does very little — turning it off simply removes the padlock line and
leaves whatever the item would otherwise show. It earns its place in combination with
`tooltip_mode: "replace"`, which together is the only way to decide every line a locked player reads:

```json
{
  "hidden_display": {
    "name_mode": "replace",
    "name_text": "Ancient Relic",
    "tooltip_mode": "replace",
    "tooltip_text": "Recovered from the ruins.\nIts purpose is not yet clear.",
    "show_lock_hints": false
  }
}
```

Without `show_lock_hints: false`, the mod's own "requires stage X" line is appended underneath and
gives the answer away.

## Overriding it for a single entry

Entries in `items` and `tags` can carry their own `name_text` and `tooltip_text`, which take
precedence over the stage-wide ones:

```json
{
  "hidden_display": {
    "name_mode": "replace",
    "name_text": "???",
    "tooltip_mode": "replace",
    "tooltip_text": "Not yet discovered."
  },
  "items": [
    "minecraft:iron_ingot",
    {
      "id": "minecraft:netherite_ingot",
      "name_text": "A Heavy Metal",
      "tooltip_text": "Heavier than gold, and it does not burn."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Only the text is overridden, never the mode.** `name_mode` and `tooltip_mode` in `hidden_display`
still decide whether replacing happens at all — an entry with a `name_text` and a stage whose
`name_mode` is `"off"` shows the real name.

## `???` is the mod's own word for "unknown"

`hidden_display` is off by default, so nothing is renamed until a stage asks for it. But if you want
a replacement name that matches the rest of the mod, use `???` — that is what the built-in lock
messages ("*??? This item is still unknown to you ???*") and the Stage Graph's hidden-stage node
already say. It is a deliberate house style rather than an unfinished placeholder.

## What hidden display does not cover

An item whose entry narrows the lock down to a single action — say
[`recipe`](/wiki/locking/items-and-recipes/unlock-actions) alone — still shows as hidden and still
carries the "requires stage X" tooltip. Both statements describe *that the item belongs to a stage*,
which stays true however narrow the gate is. Everything that actually refuses an action reads the
action list; the two display surfaces deliberately do not.
